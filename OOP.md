## Object Oriented Programming

#### OOP traits
 - Polymorphism
 - Inheritance
 - Encapsulation

The they are valued as sutch:

| Polymorphism | Inheritance | Encapsulation |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 30%          | 10%          | 60%           |


Encapsulation is the most important concept of OOP. Objects in a OOP system should hide their data from the surronding world.
When designing objects you should ask yourself; "What do I really want to ask this object?".

Dont suck the data out of objects. Ask them for what you really want to know!


#### Signs you have violated encapsulation

 - a object has to many public behaviours
 - getters, setters
 - law of demeter is broken
 - a class named something -er/-or
 - a data object
 - feature envy
