## Agile Principles

Following the agile principles in a team should result in a team that is a fun place to work.

1. Feedback
2. Communication
3. Simplicity
4. Courage
5. Respect


### Feedback

Use feedback in design

1. Customer feedback
2. Iteration/sprint - get to shippable state!
3. Standup - what did you finish yesterday?
    If someone got nothing done yesterday -> take action (why?, how can we remove blockers? etc)
4. Pair-programming
    Serves as code review

The faster you get feedback the better the quality of the product gets.

#### Remember: We can drop sermonizes and practices when good habits have formed in the team


### Communication
Distance hinders communication

#### Sit together


### Simplicity
Build the simplest thing that works

** Just in Time

Simplicity != Easy


### Courage

#### Kill Fear!

Estimates are a source of fear.


### Respect

Respect your colleges
